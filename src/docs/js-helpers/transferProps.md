# TransferProps Function

The `transferProps` function is a utility used to transfer props from one component to another while keeping the component code concise and manageable.

## Basic Usage

To use the `transferProps` function, you first need to import it:

```javascript
import { transferProps } from '../../utils/transferProps';

```

You can then use it within your components like so:

```javascript
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
    // Transfer props to a child component
    return <Child {...transferProps(props)} />;
};
```

The transferProps function ensures that only valid props are transferred, providing a clean and efficient way to pass props down the component tree.
